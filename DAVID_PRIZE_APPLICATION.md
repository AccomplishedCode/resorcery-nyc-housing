# David Prize Step 2 Application - Resorcery Platform

## 1. Tell us about YOUR New York and the opportunities you see for the city.

Walking through Downtown Brooklyn daily, I see two contrasting realities: gleaming new luxury towers next to empty storefronts that haven't reopened since COVID. Meanwhile, 250,000 families wait for affordable housing while 12,000+ vacant retail spaces sit unused across the city. This isn't just inefficiency—it's a massive missed opportunity.

I see a city where small business owners lost everything during the pandemic, leaving behind empty buildings that could solve our housing crisis. Where community boards hold heated meetings about developments that don't serve existing residents. Where data exists to make smarter decisions, but planning still happens through politics and guesswork.

The opportunity: What if we could transform vacant post-COVID buildings into community assets? What if development decisions were based on actual neighborhood needs rather than developer preferences? NYC has the data, the buildings, and the community voices—we just need to connect them intelligently.

## 2. How is your vision additive and unique to New York?

Current NYC planning relies on outdated processes: developers propose, communities react, politicians negotiate. This creates conflict, delays, and developments that don't serve neighborhoods. Existing tools like PLUTO and ZoLa provide data but require expertise to interpret. Community input happens through adversarial public meetings rather than proactive needs assessment.

Resorcery is unique because it flips this model. Instead of starting with what developers want to build, we start with what communities actually need—using real NYC open data, demographic patterns, and community board feedback to identify underutilized city-owned buildings that could address specific neighborhood gaps.

This is the right moment because: post-COVID vacancies created unprecedented opportunities, housing crisis demands faster solutions, and communities are demanding more voice in development. We can turn NYC's current crisis into a model for data-driven community development that other cities will replicate.

## 3. What have you already done to move your vision forward and what's in the way of your vision becoming a reality?

I've spent 8 months building a full demonstration platform that showcases this vision—complete 3D visualizations, policy simulators, and community impact analysis tools. I pitched an early version to NYC HPD leadership, but realized the technology-first approach flew over their heads. They couldn't see past the features to understand the community-centered purpose.

The platform exists and works, but I've learned that even the best technology means nothing without the right narrative and stakeholder buy-in. I've invested my own time and resources to prove the concept, but I'm one person without insider government connections.

Main barriers: HPD moves slowly and prefers familiar processes. Community organizations are skeptical of tech solutions. Getting access to real-time city data requires official partnerships. Most importantly, I need credibility within NYC government circles to get decision-makers to take this seriously.

The technical vision is complete—what's missing is the political and social infrastructure to implement it.

## 4. Explain what difference $200K would make for you & your vision.

$200K would transform Resorcery from a compelling demo into a real pilot program that changes how NYC develops neighborhoods.

**$75K for real data integration:** Connect to live NYC open data streams (property records, demographic data, community board feedback, 311 complaints) to move beyond mock data and show actual opportunities across all five boroughs.

**$60K for community engagement:** Partner with 3-5 community organizations in different neighborhoods to validate the platform with real residents and refine the community needs assessment methodology.

**$40K for government pilot:** Fund a 6-month pilot with one NYC agency (HPD, EDC, or DCP) to test the platform on 10 real development decisions and measure impact on approval timelines and community satisfaction.

**$25K for platform scaling:** Technical infrastructure to handle citywide data analysis and support multiple concurrent users.

This funding would prove the concept works in practice, not just theory, giving me the credibility and case studies needed to scale citywide.

## Additional David Prize Questions

### **1. In one sentence, tell us your vision to make New York City a better place. (280 characters)**

Transform NYC's 12,000+ vacant post-COVID buildings into community assets by matching underutilized spaces with actual neighborhood needs through data analysis, not political guesswork.

*[Characters: 204/280]*

### **2. Now expand on your answer: give us a broader view into your plans. (1500 characters)**

Post-COVID left NYC with a perfect storm: massive housing shortage, 12,000+ empty storefronts, and communities fighting developments that don't serve them. Resorcery connects these dots by analyzing real data to match vacant buildings with neighborhood needs.

The platform combines NYC open data (demographics, 311 complaints, business licenses) with community board feedback to identify opportunities: Which empty Target could become affordable housing? Which vacant lot needs a community center? Which underused warehouse could house local businesses?

Implementation: 6-month community validation with organizations in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx to refine needs assessment. 12-month NYC government pilot testing 10 real development decisions. 18-month citywide rollout with live data integration.

Goal: Replace adversarial "developer proposes, community reacts" with collaborative "community needs, data reveals opportunities." Target 50% faster approvals and 85% community support by starting with what neighborhoods actually want instead of what developers think they need.

Success means development that strengthens communities instead of displacing them—turning crisis into opportunity through evidence, not politics.

### **3. Why are you uniquely positioned to make your vision a reality? (1500 characters)**

I live the problem I'm trying to solve. Every day walking through Downtown Brooklyn, I pass luxury towers next to shuttered family businesses that never reopened after COVID. This isn't urban planning theory—it's my neighborhood's lived reality.

My tech background gave me skills to build complex data analysis platforms, but my failed HPD pitch taught me something more valuable: brilliant technology means nothing if you can't translate it into human impact. Government officials don't need more dashboards—they need tools that help them serve communities better.

This combination is rare: technical execution skills plus authentic urban experience plus hard-learned lessons about stakeholder communication. I can both code the algorithms to analyze citywide building data and understand why community boards reject developments that ignore local needs.

I'm not an academic studying neighborhoods from a distance, or a developer with financial motives, or a consultant selling solutions. I'm a NYC resident who sees wasted opportunities daily and has both the skills to build solutions and the humility to center community voices rather than technology features.

Most importantly: I've already failed once and learned from it.
